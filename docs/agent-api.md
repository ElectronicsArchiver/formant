### Getting started with the agent API

### What is the agent API?

The Formant agent affords a gRPC- and HTTP-compatible interface, which can be used to interact with Formant on behalf of the device. We recommend using the gRPC interface, since itâ€™s typed and more performant.

To utilize the agent API, [a Formant agent must be installed, running, and provisioned on the machine.](./agent-debian-install.md)

### What can I do with the agent API?

The following are examples of what the agent API enables:

-   Ingest telemetry datapoints
-   Trigger events
-   Update device configuration
-   Handle commands

Each of these interactions can be performed via the agent API, authenticated using the device credentials. [See the agent proto for the full set of APIs.](../protos/agent/v1/agent.proto)
